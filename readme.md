# What the bot should do:

When the *!AdvRoles* is sent, the bot should:

   1. Post a message in the chat ("Who is playing?") and add a tick emote to the message. 
   2. The bot will wait for the next command.
   3. Once the *!AdvStart* command is sent, it will check all users that have added a tick emote to the message.
   4. The bot will then DM each user that added a tick emote with a role corresponding to the game.


## Commands:

**!AdvRoles** - Tells the bot to start counting players.

**!AdvStart** - Tells the bot to start giving out roles.
